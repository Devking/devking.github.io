Specifically, the curriculum I had developed was one that was up-to-date on the latest directions in the artificial intelligence and machine learning world and allowed high school students with zero background in computer science to discuss topics such as AI bias and use libraries such as scikit-learn and Keras for deep learning in a matter of weeks.

But time and time again, folks would ask me the same question: what would you recommend as a starting point for me to learn about AI, as well as the ethical issues with it? And I'd honestly struggle a bit to answer. While there are a ton of great resources such as ",Object(i.b)("a",Object(o.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://www.elementsofai.com/"}),"Elements of AI"),", ",Object(i.b)("a",Object(o.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-ai"}),"Coursera's Introduction to AI"),", and ",Object(i.b)("a",Object(o.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://www.fast.ai/"}),"fast.AI"),", each one had benefits and drawbacks that made a recommendation incomplete.

The leading and most-used textbook in AI is and has always been ",Object(i.b)("a",Object(o.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/"}),"Russell and Norvig"),", but I had various hang-ups with recommending this textbook. For starters, it's dated. A ton of the earlier chapters cover topics like logic and symbolic AI, which... I'm not even sure most folks working in the industry on AI projects these days are concerned about. A lot has shifted into the realm of machine learning, and we have common libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow that are in use that Russell and Norvig doesn't even make hands-on use of. Don't get me wrong, it's an incredible book with tremendous depth (that I could never match in my own writing), but it's just not the resource that some folks need to quickly understand what the state of AI is like today. We need something to help folks jump right into reading and writing code for and discussing the actual applications that are rapidly being developed every day. Practical, hands-on books like ",Object(i.b)("a",Object(o.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/"}),"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, & Tensorflow by G\xe9ron")," and ",Object(i.b)("a",Object(o.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python"}),"Deep Learning with Python by Chollet")," are good for that, but they're definitely not accessible to folks outside of computer science and also jump right into the applications rather than spend time on the foundational theories and concepts. These aren't critiques of these books, by the way. These books fill a specific niche and use case, and I highly recommend them.
